what is the esense combining K-Means with AHP
What is the hierarchy of the model AHP in your context

if we talking about the HP. 
We have 3 layers, 3 main yeah, 3 main hierarchy. The first is the goal.

 the second is the criteria, and third alternative

Make me clear AHP

 2 methods, yeah, maybe some , or yeah, not all of the process

some of the process, for example, in the third and in the 4 steps you use.
 to determine 

so maybe you have to explore more. it has been in this research, yeah, 
if  will be used to calculate the ranking.

ou maybe don't have to follow all of the AHP.
But you have to know what part of the HP process that you use in your process

So you have to give more detailed explanation for this process


yang kedua

I think the result is okay.
But you have to give more explanation behind the numbers

the meaning here to the contextual problem?

Yeah. So you have to add, maybe
some of the recommendation or some of the meaning.

Yeah, you have already state above the the 3. Yeah, what? 


But yeah, like. But I just said that. Yes, 
but I already said that you have to make this more
logically acceptable.
So pay up, and we'll do it. The features here based on this segmentation.

The failure of this field, You yeah, for example, if you see if you said that 100% conscious of

500 customer, and then you said that only 80%. 
Yeah, that will be processed yet. 
So 37 is not so big compared to all the capacity. 
There. So this Why wait one way.

maybe you can. You can give your prospect perspective. 
We have formed on different angle. 
Yeah, so other people can accept, you know. Explanation.
Yeah. And then you can configure them. Yeah, this number relate to.
 So give this kind of explanation. and 

give monopolysome people said that is the monopoly. A company did not consider, not not quite, actually not, 
consider about how they can a segmented their custom model getting up. 
So this
